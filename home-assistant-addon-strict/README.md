## About

This add-on allows to run a [HomeMatic/homematicIP][homematic] control center (CCU) on
your Home Assistant. It is based on [RaspberryMatic][raspberrymatic] which
is open-source and 100% compatible with the homematic vendor ([eQ3][eq3]) own CCU
system (CCU3) to connect to HomeMatic/homematicIP devices cloudless. Furthermore,
it is based on [OCCU][occu] while providing additional exclusive features in the WebUI and
underlying operating system for an improved user experience.

ðŸš§ **WORK-IN-PROGRESS** ðŸš§<br/>
This add-on tries to provide all features of a standard, e.g. RaspberryPi or OVA-based
RaspberryMatic CCU system. **Please note:** due to the restrictive docker-based nature of
Home Assistant, some of the features require additional operating system modules which
are **not yet** available. This currently limits the HomeMatic/homematicIP connectivity to
the use of the HmIP-RFUSB, HM-LGW-O-TW-W-EU, HM-CFG-USB-2, HM-CFG-LAN and HMW-LGW-O-DR-GS-EU.
Support for e.g. the GPIO-based RF modules (RPI-RF-MOD, HM-MOD-RPI-PCB) is currently under
development.

## Features

- Use your Home Assistant central as a full-fledged HomeMatic/homematicIP control center (CCU).
- Access the CCU WebUI from your Home Assistant user interface.
- Provides all features of a RaspberryMatic system within your Home Assistant environment.
- Interconnect to HomeMatic/homematicIP devices using the standard, vendor-provided RF modules (RPI-RF-MOD, HM-MOD-RPI-PCB, HmIP-RFUSB, HM-CFG-USB-2, HM-CFG-LAN), Wired gateways (HmIPW-DRAP, HMW-LGW-O-DR-GS-EU) or LAN gateway solutions (HmIP-HAP, HM-LGW-O-TW-W-EU) â€“ see [Requirements](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/wiki/Einleitung#vorraussetzungen).
- Supports additional open-hardware based USB/Ethernet adapter devices (HB-RF-USB, HB-RF-USB-2, HB-RF-ETH).
